# Contributing

I welcome all contributions to the codebase. Please be sure to read the following guidelines before submitting any contributions.

We use ESLint to enforce a consistent code style, as well as conventional commits in order to enforce a consistent git message style. Feel free to set either (or both) of these up in your workspace.

## Setup

To setup your workspace to contribute to the project, please do the following:

1) [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository. Make sure you are on the `main` branch.
2) Run `npm install` to install the neccesary dependencies.
3) Create a new branch for your change.
4) Make your changes. Be sure to use [conventional commit messages](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
5) [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for your changes. Be sure that you base your changes on the `main` branch.
